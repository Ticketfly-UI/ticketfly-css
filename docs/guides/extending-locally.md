# Extending Ticketfly-UI-CSS

## Using Variables

Not all variables in this project are used for building the distributed CSS rules.
Some are meant as a reference -- and for easy portability into your own application.

The following variables should be defined as needed within your own project:

* [Animation Duration]()
* [Animation Timing]()
* [Breakpoints]()
