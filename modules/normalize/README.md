# Ticketfly CSS Normalize

This module is essentially Ticketfly CSS's take on CSS normalization -- inspired by the excellent
(but somewhat heavy-handed) [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) project.

Whereas a CSS reset focuses on "unstyling" things, _normalization_ aims to patch
minor bugs or tweak standard elements while still preserving
the built-in browser settings outside of its scope.
