# Ticketfly CSS Spacing Variables

_Variables for Ticketfly CSS spacing settings._

The goal of this package is to establish a standard spacing system
for Ticketfly UI -- a shared language of dimensions that can
be referenced for both designing and implementing rules for margins,
paddings, vertical rhythm, etc.
